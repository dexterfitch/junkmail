  Hi boys. I'm Tina. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. Yeah
  it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired. I'm gonna write the most
  erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. Gene, you saved us. I
  owe you my life. Detention is no big deal. Don't have a crap attack.
  It's a mating list for when the world ends. Can I get your email? I'll
  wave at you every day. Buns...sen. There is one place I like to go. The
  boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. Chad the Zombie
  touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class.
  I think her name is Kristi. A pants-off. For me? I can't tell where
  your back ends and your butt begins. So I think I'm being attacked by
  zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out
  with it. Give them ridiculous French accents.

  It includes material that may not be suitable for all ages. Just when I
  think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. You won't regret it,
  dad. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. under the disco ball, it'll be like we're
  all kissing Jimmy Jr under the disco ball. My boob? Put it on a
  t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. It's an erotic friend
  fiction story that I just wrote. I hope you like it, because you're all
  in it. It's called 'Buttloose.' Everyone touched each other's butts,
  and it was great. Hi boys. I'm Tina. Argh!... Wait, I like the library.
  And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself. I want a dry erase
  board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them
  immediately. Give them ridiculous French accents. If we see any
  mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are. How do you know
  a python ate it? Did it leave a note?
